            If you attend an adventure film festival, or read a few travel
            books, or follow any Instagram feeds with inspiring photos overlaid
            with pithy quotes, then you will have heard people pontificating

            worth asking yourself the question. The answer you settle on can
            help illuminate the direction that your plans should go.
